# Actionlogin
## for Magento 1.9

This Extension will create a controller and action to login a certain customer via an URL. The whole thing is of course protected with a hash in the URL. The URL is being printed out in a seperate log file, when the configuration is being saved. Also the Customergroup-setting will prevent certain customer groups from getting into a checkout. Should have/could have been 2 seperate extension but what the heck.
